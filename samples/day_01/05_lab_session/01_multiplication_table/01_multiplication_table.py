# Ask the user number for an integer input
number = int(input("Pick a number: "))

# Then based on that input, print the multiplication table:
# Example:
#   > Pick a number: 3
#
# Multiplication Table for 3:
#   3 x 1 = 3
#   3 x 2 = 6
#   3 x 3 = 9
#   3 x 4 = 12
#   3 x 5 = 15
#   3 x 6 = 18
#   3 x 7 = 21
#   3 x 8 = 24
#   3 x 9 = 27
#   3 x 10 = 30
#
# Challenge: What if user does not give a valid number?
