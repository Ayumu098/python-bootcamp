Project Idea: Tic Tac Toe Game

    1.) Initialize the game with an empty 3x3 board.
    2.) Alternate turns between Player 'X' and Player 'O'.
    3.) On each turn, prompt the current player to choose a position (1-9).
    4.) Check if the chosen position is valid (within range and not already occupied).
    5.) After each move, check if a player has won or if the board is full (draw).
    6.) Print the current state of the board after each move.
    7.) Announce the winner or declare a draw when the game ends.
